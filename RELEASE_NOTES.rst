.. Add new releases at the top to keep important stuff directly visible.

Release notes
=============

1.0rc4
------

* setattr_argument and setattr_device add their key to kernel_invariants.


1.0rc3
------

* The HDF5 format has changed.

  * The datasets are located in the HDF5 subgroup ``datasets``.
  * Datasets are now stored without additional type conversions and annotations
    from ARTIQ, trusting that h5py maps and converts types between HDF5 and
    python/numpy "as expected".

* NumberValue now returns an integer if ``ndecimals`` = 0, ``scale`` = 1 and
  ``step`` is integer.


1.0rc2
------

* The CPU speed in the pipistrello gateware has been reduced from 83 1/3 MHz to
  75 MHz. This will reduce the achievable sustained pulse rate and latency
  accordingly. ISE was intermittently failing to meet timing (#341).
* set_dataset in broadcast mode no longer returns a Notifier. Mutating datasets
  should be done with mutate_dataset instead (#345).


1.0rc1
------

* Experiments (your code) should use ``from artiq.experiment import *``
  (and not ``from artiq import *`` as previously)
* Core device flash storage has moved due to increased runtime size.
  This requires reflashing the runtime and the flash storage filesystem image
  or erase and rewrite its entries.
* ``RTIOCollisionError`` has been renamed to ``RTIOCollision``
* the new API for DDS batches is::

    with self.core_dds.batch:
       ...

  with ``core_dds`` a device of type ``artiq.coredevice.dds.CoreDDS``.
  The dds_bus device should not be used anymore.
* LinearScan now supports scanning from high to low. Accordingly,
  its arguments ``min/max`` have been renamed to ``start/stop`` respectively.
  Same for RandomScan (even though there direction matters little).
